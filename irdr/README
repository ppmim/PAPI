IRDR (Infrared Data Reduction)
Version: 0.93 (20 March 2001)

Introduction

  IRDR is a C library and set of stand-alone C programs and perl scripts
  for processing IR imaging data.  See the file irdr/Programs, and
  irdr/doc/irdr.ps.gz.

Installation

  download ftp://ftp.ast.cam.ac.uk/pub/sabbey/irdr-0.93.tar.gz
  gunzip irdr-0.93.tar.gz
  tar xvf irdr-0.93.tar
  cd irdr
  make all                                        # compiles WCSTools then IRDR
  setenv IRDR_BASEDIR /home/sabbey/irdr/                   # use your location
  set path = ($path $IRDR_BASEDIR/scripts $IRDR_BASEDIR/bin)
  should have "sex" command (SExtractor 2.1+) in your path

Current Limitations

  Input images can be float (bitpix -32) or signed short integer (bitpix 16)
  Ouput images are float or unsigned short integer:
    unsigned short written as bitpix 16 with BZERO 32768.0, BSCALE = 1.0
    BSCALE and BZERO are applied on input but hence dropped in output
  Some FITS images don't end in .fits, to display outside of IRAF, eg:
    linux> ds9 image.fits.skysub
  Fast histogram analysis was designed for u_short data:
    forces float and signed short data to unsigned short range (0 to 65535)
    assumes a noise level > 1 count 
  Need enough memory to hold all image planes (and weight maps) for coaddition
  Assumes input data images have same dimensions
  Expects CDELT or CDELT1 keywords, or SCALE or SECPIX (image arcsec/pixel)
  Dither offset measurement guesses that North is up and East is left

CIRSI data reduction example:

  mkdir AXAF
  cd AXAF
  cp ~/irdr/scripts/cirsi/cirsi.csh .
  vi cirsi.csh
  ./cirsi.csh >& cirsi.log &

  If you want clipping during coaddition of fewer than 5 image planes
  (using poisson noise assumption), then change mean.o to meangain.o
  in Makefile OBJ_MATH definition, and remember to setenv GAIN 10.17
  or whatever it is.

  Astrometry is done by running astrometry.pl to get reasonable astrometry
  and then astrometry_refine.pl to tweak it.  Verification is done by running
  verify.csh and then doverify.pro.  Scripts are in irdr/scripts/cirsi; add
  this directory to your IDL_PATH.

  The final step of creating a mosaic image can be done using either 
  EIS Drizzle (www.eso.org/eis) or Bertin's Swarp package.

History

  Version 0.93 (20 Mar 2001)
  Added program darkflat.c that does dark subtraction then flat correction

  Version 0.92 (02 Feb 2001)
  Modified fitsIO.c:
  Write unsigned short FITS images with BZERO 32768.0, BSCALE 1.0 convention
  Assume bitpix=16 input FITS images are signed short int (not unsigned)

  Version 0.91 (26 Jan 2001)
  Require setenv IRDR_BASEDIR /path/irdr
  Arguments to makemask.pl changed, don't need to specify config directory

  Version 0.9 (18 Jan 2001)
  Initial release
