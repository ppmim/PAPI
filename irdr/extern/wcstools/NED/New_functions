Two new functions are added in this version of NED client.

1.  Expand the reference code
      
      For a given 19-digit reference code, the function returns the detailed
      information about the it. 

      int ned_ex_refcode(char *refcode, struct reference *full_ref);

2.  Bibligraphic search for a given object

      For a given object name, it will return all the references for it
      in NED database. 

      int ned_ref(char *objname, int begin_year, int end_year,
		       int *no, CrossID **cp, NedRef **refp);

Please read NED_client for more detailed description. ex_refcode.c and ref.c
serve as simple examples to use the new functions.
