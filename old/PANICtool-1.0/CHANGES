TODO 
=====

- Write more documentation

- Create a tarball with reference frames.

- Create a script that will configure correct directory names when installing
  reference frames.

- Error handling: the python error output is very useful, but maybe could be
  reduced a bit to not confuse the end user. The backtrace maybe should be
  assigned a lower log-level than the actual error.


PANICtool-0.1
============

- Beta (alpha?) release.
