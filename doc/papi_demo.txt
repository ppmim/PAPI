QUESTIONS
=========

[0] reset in Dark/Flat series ? en principio no seria necesario, pero podemos 
dejar para ver que pasa en commissioning

[1] readout modes available and meaning and concerns to the data reduction --> 
CS nos dio los principales, aunque no se sabrá cual es el que mejor funciona 
hasta el commissioning

[2] would be interesting to have a "real-time" sky-subtraction taking into
account the last N-frames received ?  and show information about seeing, sky
background ?

[3] how does the EXPtimes work ?

[4] what are the Flat series (in calibration series) for ? are they sky or 
dome flats ? 

[5] JF req : create gainmap with "skyflat_high_level - skyflat_low_level" (and 
dithered); what kind of skyflat are they ? skyflats with fixed EXP_TIME or 
fixed EXP_LEVEL ?

[6] How to process dark series (lineal, log) in the QL ? DarkModel is too heavy ??

[7] would it be interesting to implement in the saving mode the option of save 
from frame N1 to N2 (save -r N1 N2) ?


[8] flat on/off command --> CS: not implemented yet, but could be 'tele flat on/off' 
[9] windows command
[10] cold-stop mask --> se puede mover desde GEIRS, pero parece que GEIRS no 
la mueve automaticamente al seleccionar el telescopio al iniciar GEIRS. CS 
dice que habrá una máquina para cada telescopio. Pero en cualquier caso se 
puede mover con el comando filter.

 

Q to JF
=======
- should PAPI process cubes or individual saved data files ? currently not 
supported -> si, imnplementar, puede ser necesario
- how to proceed with dark serial (lineal, log ,etc ) ? it takes long time 
to compute --> OK, QL no necesario, sólo lo básico
Me comentó que lo normal es tomar DARKs con el mismo EXPT y NCOADDS que las 
imágenes de ciencia

- diff between flats in calibrations series and fixed exp. time
- dither pattern for extended objects (


TO BE DONE
==========
[1] better grouping when OT is not used (group_by=filter)
[2] second pass sky-subtraction when extended_objects
[3] compute the distortion matrix (external to SCAMP)
 


NOTES FROM THE VISIT
====================
- All the software (OT, QL, PL) was installed in the irws2 workstation during
the first day.

- JF ask to us to prepare a list things we need and should be implemented into 
GEIRS by CS

*) OT
~~~~~
- In principle, the supported readout modes are the double correlated (lir, 
rrr-mpia), but the final desicion will be taken during the commissioning. 
- Because GEIRS will not implement the dome flat lamps control (on/off), the OT
 will command and control them via the shell commands supported by CA (E.Guindos)
- The filter wheel software is not completed in GEIRS, so we run the tests with 
the filter wheel in simulation mode.
- cold-stop filter wheel possition could be moved by OT with the filter command, 
but in principle it will not be done by the OT; it will be done by GEIRS. That 
filter wheel has a not very long life-time, so it is better do not move too much.
- In principle, reset in Dark/Flat series is not required but because they are 
implemented in OT, we can be keep them.
- New way to specify the Total exposition time ( 3+2 boxes, Total Exp.Time, 
single exp. time, IT, and to be calculated #coadds and #dither positions)
- Add the option for reading a .txt file (target, exp.times, readout, dither 
patt) in order to create automatycally the OBs required in the OT.
- Must be possible to stop and re-start the execution of any OB at a given 
position.
- OT should show the Total Exposure time of OB and the total time required 
for the execution (lap time taking into accound the overheads)
- Some sounds in OT are required in order to follow its work & status

- Concerning the Nodding procedures (S-T-T-S-T-S- etc) JF has not a clear idea
how to procedd, and suggest ask to CA staff (Ana Guijarro, Ulli, etc) to find
out the best patterns.
 
*) QL
~~~~~
- Must be possible to check the photometry of a specific star in selected in 
the display. 
In principle, imexam or qphot can be good options, taking into accound the ZP 
computed.
- In principles, the QL will not support dark series, so the dark model routine 
will not be launched with that kind of series.  

*) PL
~~~~~
- current implementations for focusing evaluation (iraf.starfocus & 
eval_focus_serie) look like good for JF 
- Should be possible to modify some of the pipeline tasks parameters (iraf 
config, SExtractor, etc) and run again the data reducion with the new setup
- In principle, all the readout modes (rrr-mpia, lir, etc) will be processed 
in the same way, no special differences for PAPI.
- Should be available some routines for health-check of the instrument, so they 
can be executed periodically and the results stored into a DB for historical 
review. JF will provided his MIDAS routines than can be used (and translated 
to Python) for this purpose. In addition, CA has a sytem for that store that 
values, so we should integrate with their system.
- A list with the main pipeline routines and a brief explanation of what they do.
- Review the FITS headers in order the ask CS what new keywords are needed.
- The science sequences files must have the same readout and saving features 
(readmode, EXPT, NCOADD,etc),and the mask dark should match with them as well.   
- should be supported the data proccessing of data when they are saved as cubes
or individual; currently only integrated mode is supported. It means changes 
in all the routines.
- Because must be possible to stop and re-start the execution of any OB at a 
given position, the PL should have some tool to try to fix the OT-headers 
keys in order to set a new sequence numbering to allow the automatic processing.

- Data processing in parallel was successfully tested; a improvement of a 
factor of 3 is achieved

- In principle, no problems running GEIRS-OT-QL-PL in the same computer 
(2xquad core CPU with 32GB RAM) --> well, we got some error running read in 
GEIRS while all process were running ( GEIRS, OT, PL with HAWK-I-3 S3, QL); CS
thinkg it could be related with the CPU load. We repeat the test after reboot
the workstation and got again the same error in the 'read' command (well, OT get
the error during the 'sync' command, but all point and CS that the problem was
in the readout) 
 
- Photometric estimation routine was shown to JF with a data set from ALHAMBRA; 
he think the procedure is OK and enought, but the difference value between 
ZP_intercept and ZP_median is too big, they should be the same, and the slope 
must be 1, and not 0.9. He does not like too much to see the fit plot with the
fitting values and the negative values in the InstMag. The only thing the
astronomer what to see is the ZP and/or the magnitude of each star.
He confirm that the STD is the precission of the photometry.  
JF suggest that review the SExtractor parameters (aperture values) because the
error might be flux computation (some flux is lost)
In addition, JF suggest that run the photometry routine in the individual images
 and check that the ZP is consistent (the same value for each image).

ITEMS for Clemens
=================
- dome flat lamp on/off 
- Fix bug in 'lir' mode that set IT to 5615secs
- subwindow commands
- filter wheel software not completelly finished
- some FITS keywords would be needed (SAVEMODE, DETECTOR parameters, ...)
- better way to know if GEIRS is running in order to avoid a bad initialization
- Give JF the extra keywords required by the OT/PL
- median command should return the values instead of read them from a text file
