PAPI INSTALLATION GUIDE
=======================

PAPI is an automatic image processing pipeline for data taken with the
PAnoramic Near Infrared Camera (PANIC) at the Calar Alto observatory
(CAHA). The pipeline currently supports imaging data from PANIC camera and is
written in Python and C making it portable across many platforms. The
automated processing steps include basic calibration (removing the
instrumental signature), cosmic-ray removal, sky subtraction, non-linear
count-rate correction, artifact masking, robust alignment and registration for
large mosaics, weight map generation, and warping onto a final image
mosaic. PAPI can be excuted both on-line in with the Quick-Look GUI or
off-line with its command line applications.
