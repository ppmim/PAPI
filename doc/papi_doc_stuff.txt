Calculating FWHM 
----------------
There are two posibilities:

a) use the option 'FHWM' on the QL Pop-up menu of to
compute the FWHM (in pixels) of the entire image selected in the QL 'Data List View'.
That is the most quick way to get an estimation of the FWHM of the entire image.
  

b) Select individually a star the get its FWHM using IRAF.imexam. For this option,
display an image and load the regions. Type "imexam" into iraf, and hit "a" once 
on each of the five stars. A row of information should appear in the iraf window 
each time you hit "a." The FWHM (in pixels) is the rightmost of these numbers. 
Average the five stars' FWHMs, and put the result into images.info. I usually 
round to three decimal places. Do this for each image.
