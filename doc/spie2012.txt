Abstract
--------  
PANIC, the Panoramic Near Infrared Camera, is an instrument for the Calar Alto Observatory which is currently being integrated in laboratory and whose first light is foreseen for this year. We present here how the PANIC Quick-Look tool (PQL) and pipeline (PAPI) are being implemented, leveraging existing rapid programming Python technologies and packages, together with well-known astronomical software suites (Astromatic, IRAF) and parallel processing techniques. We will briefly describe the structure of the PQL tool, whose original characteristics are in the use of the SQLite database and PyQt, a Python binding of the GUI toolkit Qt.  
Keywords: quick-look, pipeline, data reduction, python

1. INTRODUCTION 
---------------
In 2005, the German-Spanish Observatory of Calar Alto (CAHA) changed its administrative status, and since then Germany and Spain have given financial support in equal shares for the development of new instrumentation for the observatory through their institutions Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG) and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC).
In the frame of this agreement, the idea of building a new infrared camera for the 2.2m telescope, as the first instrument of the consortium, was suggested by both astronomical communities, supported by the Scientific Advisory Committee and approved by the Executive Committee.
The PAnoramic Near Infrared Camera (PANIC), is a new instrument for CAHA (Calar Alto Observatory) whose first light is foreseen for end this year. This instrument is the first being built inside the Spanish-German consortium signed between MPG-MPIA and CSIC-IAA for the development of new instrumentation for CAHA.
PANIC is a wide-field infrared imager for the Ritchey-Chrétien focus of the CAHA 2.2m and 3.5m telescopes. The optics is a folded single optical train, pure lens optics, with a plate scale of 0.45"/px (18 µm) at the 2.2m telescope and 0.23"/px at the 3.5m. A mosaic of four Hawaii-2RG of 2k x 2k with a gap of 3mm between the single detectors, will give a field of view of 0.5x0.5 degrees and 0.25x0.25 degrees, respectively. This cryogenic instrument will cover the photometric bands from Z to Ks (0.8 to 2.5 µm). PANIC will have a low thermal background due to cold stops. 
The instrument's cold opto-mechanics consists of 9 lenses up to 255 mm
diameter and three rectangular folding mirrors. It will be operated at about
80 K, achieved by liquid nitrogen cooling. A compact filter unit can carry up
to 19 filters distributed over four filter wheels. The mass limit of 400 kg at
the 2.2m telescope requires a low mass design: a cryostat with dished ends,
and a separate small LN2 vessel for cooling of the detector only and all parts
are light weighted and made of aluminum wherever possible.
