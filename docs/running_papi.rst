PAPI
****

.. index:: quickstart, running

Purpose
=======

PANIC pipeline (hereafter PAPI) performs the automatic data processing both for
quick-look and for science quality of the data produced by PANIC. The automated 
processing steps include basic calibration (removeing instrumental signature, dark 
and flat-fielding), cosmic-ray removal, treatment for electronic ghosts (cross-talk), 
sky subtraction, non-linear count-rate correction, robust alignment and registration
removing the field distortion.


This chapter gives an introduction in how to get started with PAPI, showing the 
steps that would normally be necessary to reduce a data set from PANIC. In particular, 
this example assumes that we have a series of FITS images from an observation run.

Quickstart
==========

Running PAPI can be as simple as executing the following command in a terminal::
	
	$ papi.py -s raw_data -d result 

Where ``raw_data`` is the directory of the raw dataset (uncalibrated) having 
both science or calibration files, and ``result`` is the path to the directory 
where the calibrated data produced by the pÃ¬peline will be saved.

Example::

   $ papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/result/directory

.. index:: uncalibrated, data



Optional Arguments
------------------

For most image sets PAPI can be run in the default configuration with no 
additional interaction required. If the default settings are insufficient for 
processing a particular data set, there are a number of run-time options which 
may be applied to help improve the reductions.

The next command will show some of the available options::

   $ papi.py --help


Then, the listing of the PAPI command line options:

Input FITS data files
---------------------

GEIRS is capable of saving the frames in different modes (integrated, FITS-cubes,
MEF, etc ). Next ones are available in the OT when the OP (Observing Program) 
is defined:

 - Multi-Extension FITS (MEF) - Integrated
 - Multi-Extension FITS (MEF) - Cube
 - Integrated All (SEF - Integrated)
 - FITS Cube (SEF - Cube)
 - Individual (SEF - Individual)
 

However, PAPI does not accept any kind of FITS data files available in GEIRS, only
the configured in the OT, except `Individual`. As result, PAPI accepts 
the next type of FITS files (in order of preference):

 - Integrated Multi-Extension-FITS (MEF): a unique FITS file with four extensions (MEF),
   where each extension corresponds to one of the 4 images produced by the single
   detector chips. 
   If the number of coadd (NCOADDS) is > 0, then they will be integrated (arithmetic sum) 
   in a single image. This is the default and more common saving mode used; in fact, it
   is the **default** and more wished saving mode.   
   This mode will also be used when the software or hardware sub-windowing is set and 
   the integrated option is selected. Then, there will be an extension for each sub-window.
 
 - Non-integrated Multi-Extension-FITS (MEF): a unique FITS file with four extensions (MEF), 
   one per each detector (or window), having each extension N planes, where N is the number 
   of coadds (NCOADDS), ie. a cube of N planes.  
   This mode will be also used when the software or hardware subwindowing is set up and 
   the no-integrated option is selected.
 
 - Single integrated FITS file: the four detectors are saved in single file and in a 
   single extension FITS image (SEF). If the number of coadds (NCOADDS) is > 0, then 
   they are integrated (arithmetic sum) in a single frame.

 - Single non-integrated FITS-cube: the four detectors are saved in a single extension 
   FITS (SEF) file, and each individual exposition in a plane/layer of a cube. It means N 
   planes, where N is the number of coadds or expositions.
 
 
 .. Note:: Currently PAPI is **not working** with non-integrated *individual* files of an 
    exposition. In case you are interested in no-integrated files and wish to reduce 
    the data with PAPI, you should use SEF of MEF non-integrated FITS-cube mode.

Show grouped files in a raw directory
-------------------------------------
For the grouping the application uses the :ref:`keywords <fits_headers>` written 
by the OT during the observation.

Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -p

Show grouped files per filter and coordinates of a raw directory 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -g filter -p 


Reduce (quick) a specificied number of sequences of the group list 
------------------------------------------------------------------
To reduce the sequneces from N1 to N2 from the group list obtained with a '-p' command,
you have to use the `-S` parameter with two values, N1 and N2, where:

   - N1: number of the first sequnece to reduce
   - N2: number of the last sequence to reduce

Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -S N1 N2 

Example::

    $papi.py -s /data2/2015-03-10/ -S 14 20

By default, PAPI process the files in quick mode (single pass for sky subtraction), 
however if you can use the 'science' mode (double pass for sky subtraction) adding
the '-M science' when you run PAPI:

Example::

    $papi.py -s /data2/2015-03-10/ -S 14 20 -M science
    

    
If you only want to reduce a specific sequence, for example number 14, you should type:

::
    
    $papi.py -s /data2/2015-03-10/ -S 14 14

Reduce all the sequences of a given directory
---------------------------------------------

Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/output/directory 
    
With this command, the pipeline will reduce all the detected sequences in the /my/raw_data/directory
using the default values set in the $PAPI_CONFIG file, and with the reduction mode specified in 
`reduction_mode` (quick, science, quick-lemon, lemon, lab).
However, you can specify the **reduction mode** (quick, science, quick-lemon, lemon) 
using the `-M` option as follow:

::
    
    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/output/directory -M quick


Reduce all the sequences of a given set of directories
------------------------------------------------------

If you need to reduce all the sequences of a given set of directories, then
you should create an script to do that; for example see next bash script:

::

    #!/bin/bash
    # Script to reduce a set of directories


    PAPI=$HOME/bin/papi.py
    CONFIG_FILE=$PAPI_CONFIG
    MY_DIRS_JAN="2015-03-05 2015-03-06 2015-03-07 2015-03-08 2015-03-09"
    for dir in $MY_DIRS
    do
        if [ ! -d /data2/out/${dir} ]
        then
            mkdir -p /data2/out/${dir}
        fi
        ${PAPI} -c $CONFIG_FILE -s /data1/PANIC/${dir} -g ot -d /data2/out/${dir} -R science
    done


Use a specific calibration directory for data reduction
-------------------------------------------------------
To reduce a complete directory using the calibration found in an specific 
directory (master dark and flat-field calibrations previously processed), 
you have to use the '-C path' option. This way, if PAPI cannot find the 
required calibrations into the input directory (/my/raw/directory), will 
look for them into the external calibration directory provided (/my/calibration/dir).

Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/output/directory -C /my/calibrations/dir

Enable the Non-Linearity correction for the data processing
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you need to enable to Non-Linearity correction (see `PANIC detector non-linearity correction data`),
you only have to edit the $PAPI_CONFIG file and set 'nonlinearity.apply' parameter
to 'True'.

Note::
    Be ware that when using Non-Linearity correction, all the files used and calibrations,
    must be non-linearity corrected. Otherwise, you don't get an consistent result.


Reduce a single detector
------------------------
By default PAPI processes all the detector and builds the mosaic with the reduced detectors.
However, if you do not need to reduce all the detectors, but only one of them (Q1...Q4), you
can use the option '-W Qx'::

    -W DETECTOR, --window_detector=DETECTOR
                                Specify which detector to process:Q1(SG1), Q2(SG2),
                                Q3(SG3), Q4(SG4), Q123(all except SG4), all [default:
                                all]

Example::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/output/directory -W Q1
    
    
Reduction modes
===============

PAPI currectly supports next reduction modes:

  - quick (default): single pass for sky background subtraction 
  - science: double pass for sky background subtraction
  - quick-lemon: single pass for sky background and neither alignment nor coadd is done.
  - lemon: double pass for sky background subtraction, and neither alignment nor coadd is done.
  - lab: for laboratory purposes

  
For more details, see :ref:`processing`.

How NOT to use PAPI
===================

PAPI uses a strictly linear approach for data reduction, which makes for easy and
transparent processing. And you have to stick to that. It is usually not possible 
to take data that has been processed half-way by other software and do the rest 
in PAPI. FITS headers will not be understood, naming conventions not met, and 
data structures totally incompatible.

	
Configuration files
===================
PAPI has a set of configuration files required to run properly. They are the next
ones:

   * papi.cfg:  main configuration file

      In addition to the command line options, PAPI has a configuration file in 
      which the user can set both the command line options  and a wider set of 
      additional ones. 
      This config file can be specified with the ``-c`` option, but by default it 
      is looked for it in the ``config_files`` directory defined by PAPI_CONFIG 
      environment variable.

   * scamp.cfg: SCAMP configuration file
   * swarp.conf: SWARP configuration file
   * sextractor.sex : SExtractor configuration file
   * sextractor.conf: 
   * sextractor.cong:
   * sextractor.nnw:
   * sextractor.param:

.. _config:

Main config file
================

This file has a structure similar to that of Microsoft Windows INI files. It is 
divided into âsectionsâ, each of which has a number of âname = valueâ entries. 
The order in which sections appear is not important. 

Any plain text editor can be used to do edit the file. If some section or 
keyword is missing, the application will fail and inform about that.

Principal parameters to set
---------------------------
Although all parameteres of the config file ($PAPI_CONFIG) are important, some of them have special 
relevance to the right execution and in the results obtained (in bold are default values):

- apply_dark_flat: (0 | **1** | 2)

- remove_crosstalk: (**True** | False)  

- nonlinearity::apply: (True | **False**)

- ext_calibration_db: (path)

- group_by: (**ot** | group)

- bpm::mode (**none** | fix | grab ) 


.. _bad_pixel_treatment:

Bad Pixel treatment
-------------------

- mode = None

No BPM file will be read. Bad Pixels will be determined using the
GainMap obtained from the Superflat or Skyflat.
During sky-filtering, the computed bad pixels (from gainMap) will be replaced
with NaNs. However, in science mode, on the first pass of skyfilter
and in order to get a good object mask, the bad pixels will be
replaced by the background level.

- mode = grab

Read (if exists) BPM file; read bad pixels will be added to bad pixels
computed in the gainmap.
During sky-filtering, the bad pixels (read + computed) will be replaced 
by NaN. However, in science mode, on the first pass of skyfilter and in 
order to get a good object mask, the bad pixels will be replaced by the 
background level.

- mode = fix

Read (if exists) BPM file; read bad pixels will be replaced by
bi-linear interpolation during dark and flat-fielding and before sky
filtering (sky subtraction).
During sky-filtering, bad pixels computed in the gainMap will be 
replaced with the background level.

The prefered mode is 'grab' whether you want to use a BPM file, or
none if you do not.


Getting PAPI Data
=================

PAPI requires the full set of uncalibrated data products 
and best reference files for each observation in the input image set. These files 
can be readily obtained through the CAHA_ archive. When
requesting data from CAHA you need to specify:
   
   * Instrument : **PANIC**
   * Science Files Requested: **Uncalibrated - Raw** 
   * Reference Files: **Advanced Data Products**

Caveats
=======

As we stated previously, PAPI was developed primarily for reducing NIR imaging
data of any kind of sources (galactic, extragalactic, coarse or crowed fields, 
and extended objects). Here are some tips for reducing each types of data:

* Coarse fields:
* Crowded fields:
* Extended objects:
