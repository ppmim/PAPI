Running PAPI
============

.. index:: quickstart, running

Quickstart
**********

Running PAPI can be as simple as executing the following command in a terminal::
	
	$ papi.py -s raw_data -d result 

Where ``raw_data`` is the directory of the raw dataset (uncalibrated) having 
both science or calibration files, and ``result`` is the path to the directory 
where the calibrated data produced by the p√¨peline will be saved.

Example::

   $ papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/result/directory

.. index:: uncalibrated, data



Optional Commands
*****************

For most image sets PAPI can be run in the default configuration with no 
additional interaction required. If the default settings are insufficient for 
processing a particular data set, there are a number of run-time options which 
may be applied to help improve the reductions.

The next command will show some of the available options::

   $ papi.py --help


Then, the listing of the PAPI command line options::

    Usage: papi.py [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
    
    This is the main module of the PANIC data reduction system (PAPI)

                            of rows specified (0 to N, both included)

      -l, --list            Generate a list with all the source files read from
                            the source only sorted by MJD
      -M REDUCTION_MODE, --red_mode=REDUCTION_MODE
                            Mode of data reduction to do (lemon|quick|science)

      -S SEQ_TO_REDUCE, --seq_to_reduce=SEQ_TO_REDUCE
                            Sequence number to reduce. By default,
                            all sequences found will be reduced.
      -D MASTER_DARK, --master_dark=MASTER_DARK
                            master dark to subtract
      -F MASTER_FLAT, --master_flat=MASTER_FLAT

                            bad pixel mask file
      -g GROUP_BY, --group_by=GROUP_BY
                            kind of data grouping (based on) to do with the
                            dataset files (ot |filter)
      -k, --check_data      if true, check data properties matching (type, expt,
                            filter, ncoadd, mjd)
      -v, --verbose         Verbose mode [default]

  
	
Configuration files
*******************
PAPI has a set of configuration files required to run properly. They are the next
ones:

   * papi.cfg:  main configuration file

      In addition to the command line options, PAPI has a configuration file in 
      which the user can set both the command line options  and a wider set of 
      additional ones. 
      This config file can be specified with the ``-c`` option, but by default it 
      is looked for it in the ``config_files`` directory defined by PAPI_CONFIG 
      environment variable.

   * scamp.cfg: SCAMP configuration file
   * swarp.conf: SWARP configuration file
   * sextractor.sex : SExtractor configuration file
   * sextractor.conf: 
   * sextractor.cong:
   * sextractor.nnw:
   * sextractor.param:

Show grouped files in a row directory
-------------------------------------
Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -p

Show grouped files per filter and coordinates in a row directory 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Command::

    $papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -g filter -p 


Getting PAPI Data
*****************

The PAPI pipeline requires the full set of uncalibrated data products 
and best reference files for each observation in the input image set. These files 
can be readily obtained through the CAHA_ archive. When
requesting data from CAHA you need to specify:
   
   * Instrument : **PANIC**
   * Science Files Requested: **Uncalibrated - Raw** 
   * Reference Files: **Advanced Data Products**

Troubleshooting
***************

As we stated previously, PAPI was developed primarily for reducing NIR imaging
data of any kind of sources (galactic, extragalactic, coarse or crowed fields, 
and extended objects). Here are some tips for reducing each types of data:

* Coarse fields:
* Crowded fields:
* Extended objects:
