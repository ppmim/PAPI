Running PAPI
============

.. index:: quickstart, running


Quickstart
**********

Running PAPI can be as simple as executing the following command in a terminal::
	
	$ papi.py -s raw_data -d result 

Where ``raw_data`` is the directory of the raw dataset (uncalibrated) having 
both science or calibration files, and ``result`` is the path to the directory 
where the calibrated data produced by the p√¨peline will be saved.

Example::

   $ papi.py -s /my/raw_data/directory -d /my/result/directory

.. index:: uncalibrated, data



Optional Commands
*****************

For most image sets PAPI can be run in the default configuration with no 
additional interaction required. If the default settings are insufficient for 
processing a particular data set, there are a number of run-time options which 
may be applied to help improve the reductions.

The next command will show some of the available options::

   $ papi.py --help


Then, the listing of the PAPI command line options::

Input FITS data files
*********************
GEIRS is capable of saving the frames in different modes (integrated, FITS-cubes,
MEF, etc ). It can be configured in the OT when the OP (observing program) is defined.

However, PAPI does not accept any kind of FITS data files available in GEIRS, only
the configured in the OT. As result, PAPI could accept the next type of FITS files:

 - Single integrated FITS file: the four detectors are saved in single file and in a single stitched image. This is the default and more common saving mode used. 

 - Single non-integrated FITS-cube: the four detectors are saved in a single file in a single stitched image, and each individual exposition in a plane of a cube. It means N planes, where N is the number of coadds or expositions.

 - Non-integrated Multi-Extension-FITS (MEF): a unique FITS file with four extensions (MEF), one per each detector (or window), having each extension N planes, where N is the number of expositions (coadds), ie. a cube of N planes.  
 This mode will be also used when the software or hardware subwindowing is set up and the no-integrated option is selected.
 Currently integrated MEF are not available in GEIRS (and therefore nor in OT), but integrated subwindows/detectors can be generated only as separated files, one for each defined subwindow/detector.

 .. Note:: Currently PAPI is not working with non-integrated separated files of an exposition. In case you are interested in no-integrated files and wish to reduce the data with PAPI, you should use single non-integrated FITS-cube mode.

   

How NOT to use PAPI
*******************

PAPI uses a strictly linear approach for data reduction, which makes for easy and
transparent processing. And you have to stick to that. It is usually not possible 
to take data that has been processed half-way by other software and do the rest 
in PAPI. FITS headers will not be understood, naming conventions not met, and 
data structures totally incompatible.

	
Configuration files
*******************
PAPI has a set of configuration files required to run properly. They are the next
ones:

   * papi.cfg:  main configuration file

      In addition to the command line options, PAPI has a configuration file in 
      which the user can set both the command line options  and a wider set of 
      additional ones. 
      This config file can be specified with the ``-c`` option, but by default it 
      is looked for it in the ``config_files`` directory defined by PAPI_CONFIG 
      environment variable.

   * scamp.cfg: SCAMP configuration file
   * swarp.conf: SWARP configuration file
   * sextractor.sex : SExtractor configuration file
   * sextractor.conf: 
   * sextractor.cong:
   * sextractor.nnw:
   * sextractor.param:

Getting PAPI Data
*****************

The PAPI pipeline requires the full set of uncalibrated data products 
and best reference files for each observation in the input image set. These files 
can be readily obtained through the CAHA_ archive. When
requesting data from CAHA you need to specify:
   
   * Instrument : **PANIC**
   * Science Files Requested: **Uncalibrated - Raw** 
   * Reference Files: **Advanced Data Products**

Troubleshooting
***************

As we stated previously, PAPI was developed primarily for reducing NIR imaging
data of any kind of sources (galactic, extragalactic, coarse or crowed fields, 
and extended objects). Here are some tips for reducing each types of data:

* Coarse fields:
* Crowded fields:
* Extended objects:
