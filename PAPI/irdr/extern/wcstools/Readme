WCSTools

WCSTools is a set of software utilities, written in C, which create,
display and manipulate the world coordinate system of a FITS or IRAF
image, using specific keywords in the image header which relate pixel
position within the image to position on the sky.  Auxillary programs
search star catalogs and manipulate images.

To make the entire package, type

make all

in the main directory or, on Solaris machines

make -f Makefile.solaris

This is version 3.6.4 of the WCSTools package developed by Doug Mink
(dmink@cfa.harvard.edu) at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,
with significant code or algorithms from

Bill Cotton of NRAO (projection),
Mark Calabretta of CSIRO (projection),
Jesse Doggett and Rick White of StScI (DSS projection)
Pat Wallace of Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK (coordinate conversion),
Elwood Downey of the University of Iowa (WCS fitting procedure),
John Roll of SAO for (network access), and
Jing Li of IPAC (distortion).

Bill Joye and Eric Mandel of SAO, Allan Brighton of ESO, and Jean-Baptiste
Marquette of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, and David Shupe of IPAC
helped debug the subroutine library.  Norman Grogin, Scott Kenyon, Susan
Tokarz, Dan Koranyi, Guillermo Torres, and others of SAO and Andreas Jaunsen
helped debug the astrometry programs.
Steve Willner of SAO helped debug the FITS utilities.

Details of updates are in the NEWS file.

A paper presented at the 2001 ADASS conference describes how the
WCSTools package uses the web, among other new features:
     "WCSTools 3.0: More Tools for Image Astrometry and Catalog Searching",

This paper presented at the 2002 ADASS conference describes interesting
ways to use the SCAT program:

     Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems XII, whenever it comes out.

To assist users in selecting the best catalog to use, we tested the accuracy of
the various catalogs one is likely to use with imwcs, showing how well it works
in a pipeline mode on 1728 images. This ADASS paper is an improved version of
our AAS/DDA paper, adding the UCAC2 catalog and emphasizing usefulness more than
astrometry:
